# 📊 Examining Bias in the VI-SPDAT: Machine Learning, Housing Placement, and Systemic Intervention
Graduate Capstone Final Github


This project explores the use of supervised machine learning models to predict VI-SPDAT assessment scores and housing outcomes based on wellness and demographic data,  This project has become a defining part of my graduate school experience, and I hope that it leads to data and its ability to improve the real world.
